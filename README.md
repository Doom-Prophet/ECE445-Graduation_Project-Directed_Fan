# ECE445-Graduation_Project-Directed_Fan
 - Group project to self design and assemble a fan that can direct itself towards human automatically and change speed through voice commands.
 - The group is made up of four members, with three other classmates from Mechanical Engineering. I'm responsible for voice command functionality. 
 - Here the repo only contains all the codes for voice command functionality, written entirely by myself.
